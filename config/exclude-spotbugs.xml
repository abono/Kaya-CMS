    In order to do proper dependency injection so Spring auto wires objects together on startup, we
    need the various beans to contain other beans (DAO's hold the JDBC Template, Services contain
    the DAOs, Controllers hold the service objects, etc.).  Spot Bugs really hates this and flags
    errors in these objects with the EI_EXPOSE_REP2 bug.  For this reason we are just going to turn
    this bug off globally.

    <Bug pattern="EI_EXPOSE_REP2"/>

  <!-- =============================================================================================
    Spot Bugs wants immutable beans all over the place to ensure that objects are not modified
    unexpectedly.  This is all well and good but crudial libraries such as JPA/Hibernate require
    setters on the beans in order to function properly.  Because of this, we will be turning off
    these checks for our beans.
